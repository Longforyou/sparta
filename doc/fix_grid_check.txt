fix grid/check command :h3

[Syntax:]

fix ID grid/check N outflag :pre

ID is documented in "fix"_fix.html command
grid/check = style name of this fix command
N = check every N timesteps
outflag = {error} or {warn} or {silent} :ul

[Examples:]

fix 1 grid/check 100 error :pre

[Description:]

Check if particles are inside the grid cell they are supposed to be,
based on their current coordinates.  This is useful as a debugging
check to insure that no particles have been assigned to the incorrect
grid cell during the particle move stage of the SPARTA timestepping
algorithm.

The check is performed once every {N} timesteps.  Particles not inside
the correct grid cell are counted and the value of the count can be
monitored (see below).  A value of 0 is "correct", meaning that no
particle was found outside its assigned grid cell.

If the outflag setting is {error}, SPARTA will print an error and stop
if it finds a particle in an incorrect grid cell.  For {warn}, it will
print a warning message and continue.  For {silent}, it will print no
message, but the count of such occurrences can be monitored as
described below, e.g. by outputting the value with the
"stats"_stats.html command.

[Restart, output info:]

No information about this fix is written to "binary restart
files"_restart.html.

This fix computes a global scalar which can be accessed by various
output commands.  The scalar is the count of how many particles were
not in the correct grid cell.  The count is cummulative over all the
timesteps the check was performed since the start of the run.  It is
initialized to zero each time a run is performed.

[Restrictions:] none

[Related commands:] none

[Default:] none
